## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://aafi.xyz/screenshots/ayxhj0pz1zj6mxcj6c3hwcf9i3.png)

This was a site that I was paid to create and manage unfortunately the creator of the site got someone else to erase my work and claim it as their own. I want to put the site out here as a result to make it open-source and free to use to the public. Due to the fact that someone blatantly stole my code to the original site and erased all the metadata that I had on the site saying I was the one who made the site. I'm leaving it here now to add to my portfolio to showcase my awesome work.  


## Getting Started

To install the site directly copy and paste the following: 

```git-clone https://github.com/aayuri/nicesite```

## Usage

Anyone can use the site as of now and modify the site as their own and give the template some of youro own touches. Feel free to fork the site to use as a template to create your own professional website.
